## What is missing
In order to get the code ready in time there are some lacking features  that I would  like to comment on:
- I am still getting confortable with JWT tokens. Because of this, I was not able to specifically add a UserId in order to complete posts requirements.  However, the token works just fine
- App does not support filtering by title and category at the same time (will be easily fixed in no time!)
- App does not check for .png nor .jpeg at the end of Image urls
- Testing is not provided  in  this application (this is a topic in which I have little to zero real hands-on experience)
- App does not check for valid parameters (yet)
- This is the first time that I have provided documentation, so any advice will be received with open arms



##### To be kept in mind
1. Database used : MYSQL
2. Documentation can be found in main
3. Any feedback will always be gladly welcomed
